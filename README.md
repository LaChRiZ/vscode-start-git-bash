# README

This small Visual Studio Code extension adds a "bash" command to VSCode that allows you to start git-bash with the current working folder 
as the VSCode workspace's root folder.

Press F1 and then type "bash" to start git-bash.exe.
You'll have to have git-bash.exe on the environment path.

**Enjoy!**
