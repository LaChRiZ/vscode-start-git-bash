# README

This small Visual Studio Code extension adds a "bash" command to VSCode that allows you to start git-bash with the current working folder 
as the VSCode workspace's root folder.

Press F1 and then type "bash" to start git-bash.exe.


**You'll have to have git-bash.exe on the environment path.**

**Enjoy!**

##Version 1.0.2
* Improved error checking when git-bash isn't on the path
* No longer opens an informational message when it opens git-bash (that you then have to close each time, which is annoying).
